# Austin's Favourite Things

Hello, and welcome to my page about my three favourite things. 
<br> 
Take a look around and see if we have anything in common!

## Setup

To setup the site, load the database from the assets folder locally (this can be done through a SQL terminal, or PHPMyAdmin).
<br>
Open up the project and type **npm install** into the console. This will install all needed packages.
<br>
**Note** Sometimes errors may occur, if so, run **npm install -D nodemon** to resolve said error.
<br>
After the packages are installed, run **npm start** in the console to start the site, then navigate to **localhost:3000** in your browser.
<br>
**Also Note** If you are viewing this on MAC, please go into the config.js and change the port to **8889**, as well as the password to **root**
<br>
After that, the site is good to go!

## Tools Used
**Microsoft Visual Studio Code** - To create the site design, write the code to host a server, and load the page
<br>
**PHPMyAdmin** - To create a SQL table and to host the database

## Author
**Austin Caron** - Creator of site, generator of assets and dynamic content, and lover of things!

## Future Goals
The plan is to add more content as time progresses, evolving what I think are my favourite things.
